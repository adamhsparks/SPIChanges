Description: The package improves the interpretation of the 
   Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) under changing climate conditions. 
   It is based on the nonstationary approach proposed in Blain et al. (2022) 
   <doi:10.1002/joc.7550> to detect trends in rainfall quantities and to quantify 
   the effect of such trends on the probability of a SPI value occurring.
